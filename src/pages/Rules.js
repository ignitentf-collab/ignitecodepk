        <h2>Competition Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Ignite, at its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to
          disqualify any team and/or forfeit any Prize(s) that any participant
          may be eligible to receive if Ignite reasonably believes such
          participants, where applicable, is/are in breach of these Competition
          Rules.
        </p>

        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          Participants must compete as part of a team. A team is comprised of 3
          members. Only those members who register in a team are allowed to
          participate in the competition. Universities and Colleges can have
          multiple teams.
        </p>

        <h2>Registration</h2>
        <p>
          Upon registration, participants must submit required data, including
          their name, postal address, phone number, email address, etc. Ignite
          may use such information to contact participants, confirm their
          eligibility, and for other purposes related to the Competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          A participant may only create one (1) valid participant profile when
          registering for the competition. You risk disqualification if you
          participate in the Competition using multiple participant profiles.
        </p>

        <h2>Assignments</h2>
        <p>
          All assignments are developed and judged by experts. Assignments will
          be categorized as easy, medium, hard, and difficult. An assignment can
          be solved in any of the supported programming languages i.e., Java,
          C/C++, Python. Each assignment will have time and memory limits.
        </p>

        <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>
          Ignite reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to review the
          submissions to detect any act of plagiarism and to disqualify any team
          identified (during or after the competition) for inappropriate
          collaboration, reuse of material, and/or failing to meet the
          requirements as indicated by the contest rules.
        </p>

        <h2>Selection of Winners</h2>
        <p>
          Winners are selected based on overall score. In the case of a tie,
